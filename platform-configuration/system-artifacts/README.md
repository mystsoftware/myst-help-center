Can I control deployments of system-artifacts during provisioning?

Yes, now you can control the deployments of system-artifacts in a phased manner to run pre/post any action.

# Prerequisites #

####System-Artifacts####
System-Artifacts are the artifacts which have the dependency on the provisioning life-cycle and they need to be deployed during the provisioning of the environment.

***Note***:- *System-artifact are completely different from the artifacts as they are dependent on the provisioning life-cycle. System artifacts are not controlled from Release Management unlike the usual artifacts and are defined from the Global Variable*. 

***Example***: MQ library is an example of the system-artifact as it needs to be deployed before the action configure-jca to make sure the configuration is appropriate and hence it needs to be deployed during the provisioning of the environment.




# Problem #

How to control the deployment phase of system-artifacts during the provisioning of an environment.

Phase deployment feature is introduced in the MyST 5.8.2 version and customers using the earlier versions can achieve provisioning-time deployments by defining a Global Variable property **action.create-resource.pre=download-deploy-artifacts,deploy** where **create-resource** is the name of the action.

### Drawback with earlier approach ###

The user did not have the control over the deployments of system-artifacts as MyST deployed all the artifacts at a go which caused a few issues. 
Now, with the MyST versions 5.8.2, each system-artifact can be deployed at a desired level.

***Example***: A user can deploy shared library system-artifact as a pre create-resource action and also deploy a wsm policy as a post copy-domain action.

# Solution #

Deployments of system-artifacts can be achieved in two ways, either from the MyST Studio or from MyST CLI. The property core.deployment[ID].param[phase] is used to define the stage of deployment of the system-artifact where ID denotes the unique identifier for the artifact instance.

### MyST Studio ###

- Login to MyST Studio, navigate to Platform Blueprint/Platform Model -> Edit Configuration -> Global Variable.
- Add the core.deployment properties of the system-artifact as shown in the below screenshot.

- The property highlighted above core.deployment[ID].param[phase] defines the phase where the system-artifact has to be deployed, you can either set it to pre/post to any action in the provisioning life-cycle.
- For instance if you want to schedule the deployment before the action create-resource then you can set it as shown in the above screenshot.
- Go to Platform Model -> Action -> Provision
- This will deploy the system-artifact during the provisioning of the environment.

### MyST CLI ###

- Define the core.properties for the deployment under the mystWorkspace/conf/fc.properties as shown below.

    	core.deployment[ID].artifact.repository.artifactId=wspolicy
    	core.deployment[ID].artifact.repository.groupId=com.rubiconred
    	core.deployment[ID].artifact.repository.type=jar
    	core.deployment[ID].artifact.repository.version=1.0-3
    	core.deployment[ID].param[extract-files]=policy
    	core.deployment[ID].param[phase]=create-resource-post
    	core.deployment[ID].type=wspolicy 

- The property highlighted above core.deployment[ID].param[phase] defines the phase where the system-artifact has to be deployed, you can either set it to pre/post to any action in the provisioning life-cycle. 
- For instance if you want to schedule the deployment after the action create-resource then you can set the parameter as shown in the above properties.
- Run the provision action from the MyST CLI.
- This will deploy the system-artifact during the provisioning of the environment.
